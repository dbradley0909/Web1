		<h3><b>About me..</b></h3>
		<p>Hello, my name is Dana. I am from New orleans.I am interested in becoming a security software engineer. My reasons are:
			
				<ul></ul>
				<li>Due to my mother being a victim of identity theft.</li>
				<li>it has been the most challenging subject I have learned and  like it.</li>
				<li>Wanted a change in my career!</li>
                <ul></ul>
                I only have clerical skills. I know how to use computers but i dont know how they really work or function. I plan on going back to schoool to further my education and learn computer science. Welp! that is all I can say about myself!
