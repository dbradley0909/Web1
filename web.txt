	The Internet works like a global computer network for communication. The Internet simply moves data from one place to another, so that we can chat, browse and share. They do this buy using something called a URL which is a mixture of a protocol, domain, and endpoint being requested. They also use things like HTTPS, query, and params which are extra parts of the Url that sends data.
	 When you click on a link, your browser and operating system figure out where you've clicked. The web page that you're viewing has hidden information associated with whatever you clicked on. it sends info back and forth from IP addreses. also you must be careful when clicking links even though it is not full proof some links have http which is usually not secure and some have https which ahs some form of security.
